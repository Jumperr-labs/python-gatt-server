# Python BLE GATT Server (peripheral)
GATT is constructed out of one or more server devices (BLE peripherals) and a client device (BLE central).

A GATT server is usually a small device such as a sensor, but for some use cases you might want to have a Linux computer such as a RPi used as a GATT server. This example is meant to demonstrate how this can be done.


## Setup
The instructions in this document were tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

### Bluez Installation
On most distributions, you will need to upgrade Bluez in order to make this work.

Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev libglib2.0-dev libdbus-1-dev
```

Download and install Bluez

```bash
wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-5.45.tar.xz
tar xvf bluez-5.45.tar.xz
cd bluez-5.45/
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

### Added by Rida: Fixes required in bluez code for successful compilation (in case it fails):
'SIOCGSTAMP' undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean 'SIOCSRARPâ€™
resolution: https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=e62786ddceb7376cb9abf97d0b89fdc62ea7dcb3
```
add #include<linux/sockios.h> to tools/rctest.c
add #include<linux/sockios.h> to tools/l2test.c
```

Enable experimental features for the bluetooth driver: 
- `sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service`
- Add `--experimental` to `ExecStart`. The line should look like this: 

    `ExecStart=/usr/local/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd --experimental`

Reload the service:
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
sudo service bluetooth restart
```

### virtualenv
Install dependencies: `sudo apt-get install virtualenv python-dev libdbus-1-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev python-gi`

`cd` to the the root of this repository and:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
[most probably not required!] ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gi venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
```

## Installing some Ubuntu and Python packages
```sudo apt-get install python3-dev
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libcairo2-dev gcc python3-dev libgirepository1.0-dev
sudo apt-get install python-dbus
pip install gobject PyGObject
pip install dbus-python
```

## Usage
Start the sample BLE GATT server: `python gatt_server_example.py`

You can use a smartphone as a GATT client. I used the [GATT-IP](http://www.gatt-ip.org/) app, here it is on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.gatt_ip.activity&hl=en) and on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gatt-ip-bluetooth-smart-le-proxy-protocol/id940105344?mt=8)
